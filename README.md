# Sign-language-to-Speech-or-Text-Converter
## Introduction:
Sign Language is the most natural and expressive way for the
hearing impaired people. People, who are not deaf, never try
to learn the sign language for interacting with the deaf people.

This leads to isolation of the deaf people. But if the computer
can be programmed in such a way that it can translate sign
language to text format, the difference between the normal
people and the deaf community can be minimized. 

## Motivation : 
  What coulde be the perfect way to utilize the unfortunate lockdown? Like most of pepole use this period to do many thinks that they likes that is they learn new skills , watching videos ,series on netflix or amazon prime . I Use this period to learn new skill and by learning new skill develop one project that solve the real world problem. While searching such project I saw one project topic on the website that name is sign language to text or speech converter. When I read the prolem statement of this topic then I decited that I have to work on this project because it solves the real world problem for deaf people. It provide the way to communicate with normal pepole.
