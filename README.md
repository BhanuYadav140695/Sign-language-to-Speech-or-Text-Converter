# Sign-language-to-Speech-or-Text-Converter
##Introduction:
Sign Language is the most natural and expressive way for the
hearing impaired people. People, who are not deaf, never try
to learn the sign language for interacting with the deaf people.
This leads to isolation of the deaf people. But if the computer
can be programmed in such a way that it can translate sign
language to text format, the difference between the normal
people and the deaf community can be minimized. Indian sign
language (ISL) uses both hands to represent each alphabet and
gesture. ISL alphabets are derived from British Sign Language
(BSL) and French Sign Language (FSL). Most of the
researchers in this area concentrate on the recognition of
American Sign Language (ASL) since most of the signs in
ASL are single handed and thus, complexity is less. Another
attractive feature is that ASL already has a standard database
that is available for use. When compared with ASL, Indian
Sign Language relies on both hands and thus, an ISL
recognition system is more complex. A few research works
carried out by the researchers in the recognition of ISL.
Currently, more researchers have started doing research in
ISL. Here this proposed system is able to recognize the
various alphabets of Indian Sign Language; this will reduce
the noise and give accurate result.
