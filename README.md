# Sign-language-to-Speech-or-Text-Converter
## Introduction:
Sign Language is the most natural and expressive way for the
hearing impaired people. People, who are not deaf, never try
to learn the sign language for interacting with the deaf people.

This leads to isolation of the deaf people. But if the computer
can be programmed in such a way that it can translate sign
language to text format, the difference between the normal
people and the deaf community can be minimized. 

Indian sign language (ISL) uses both hands to represent each alphabet and
gesture. ISL alphabets are derived from British Sign Language
(BSL) and French Sign Language (FSL). Most of the
researchers in this area concentrate on the recognition of
American Sign Language (ASL) since most of the signs in
ASL are single handed and thus, complexity is less. 

Another attractive feature is that ASL already has a standard database
that is available for use. When compared with ASL, Indian
Sign Language relies on both hands and thus, an ISL
recognition system is more complex. A few research works
carried out by the researchers in the recognition of ISL.
Currently, more researchers have started doing research in
ISL. Here this proposed system is able to recognize the
various alphabets of Indian Sign Language; this will reduce
the noise and give accurate result.

## Related Works:
  A various hand gestures were recognized with different 
methods by different researchers in which were implemented 
in different fields. The recognition of various hand gestures 
were done by vision based approaches, data glove based 
approaches, soft computing approaches like Artificial Neural 
Network, Fuzzy logic, Genetic Algorithm and others like 
PCA, Canonical Analysis, etc. The recognition techniques are 
divided into three broad categories such as Hand segmentation 
approaches, Feature extraction approaches and Gesture 
recognition approaches.

“Application research on face detection technology uses Open 
CV technology in mobile augmented reality” introduces the 
typical technology. Open source computer vision library, 
Open CV for short is a cross-platform library computer vision 
based on open source distribution. The Open CV, with C 
language provides a very rich visual processing algorithm to 
write it part and combined with the characteristics of its open 
source. Data gloves and Vision based method are commonly 
used to interpret gestures for human computer interaction. 
The sensors attached to a glove that finger flexion into 
electrical signals for determining the hand posture in the data 
gloves method. The camera is used to capture the image 
gestures in the vision based method. The vision based method 
reduces the difficulties as in the glove based method.
“Hand talk-a sign language recognition based on 
accelerometer and semi data” this paper introduces American 
Sign Language conventions. It is part of the “deaf culture” and 
includes its own system of puns, inside jokes, etc. It is very 
difficult to understand understanding someone speaking 
Japanese by English speaker. The sign language of Sweden is 
very difficult to understand by the speaker of ASL. ASL 
consists of approximately 6000 gestures of common words 
with spelling using finger used to communicate obscure words 
or proper nouns. 

“Hand gesture recognition and voice conversion system for 
dumb people” proposed lower the communication gap 
between the mute community and additionally the standard 
world. The projected methodology interprets language into 
speech. The system overcomes the necessary time difficulties 
of dumb people and improves their manner. Compared with 
existing system the projected arrangement is simple as well as 
compact and is possible to carry to any places. This system 
converts the language in associate text into voice that's well 
explicable by blind and ancient people. The language 
interprets into some text kind displayed on the digital display 
screen, to facilitate the deaf people likewise. In world 
applications, this system is helpful for deaf and dumb of us 
those cannot communicate with ancient person.
